**Create and run your own Javascript files**

This Unit is not a teaching Unit. It's main purpose is to allow students to add and run their own Javascript code files.

## Creating a new Javascript file
To create a new Javascript file, please follow these steps.

1. Select the 'File' menu item at the top of this page.
1. Select 'New File' from the drop down menu.
1. In the dialog that appears, locate the 'File Name' field.
1. Enter 'filename.js' in this field, where 'filename' is a name you choose for your file. 
1. Press 'OK' and a new window will appear where you can start coding.

You can create as many code files as you like in this project.

## Running your Javascript code
There are two ways to do this.

#### Run Current menu item
In the menu at the top, you can see there is a menu item **Run Current**. If you press this, it will run the currently selected code file. 

If the terminal window is open, then it will not work. You need to have the Javascript code window currently selected.

#### Using the command line interface
If you are familiar with the Linux command line, you can also open up a terminal window from the **Tools->Terminal** menu. 

Once this appears, you should enter the following

- `node yourfilename.js`

## Advanced
If you want to have multiple panels open, you can add and close coding panels from the **View->Panels** menu.
